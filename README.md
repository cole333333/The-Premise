# The-premise-novel-
book about travel between worlds

this is my novel, i started writing it as a way to pass time between classes. now that im invested it is an outlet for brainchildren of mine that i find myself thinking of throuought my life. specifically these ideas are for worldbuilding and charecter desighn. going into this i know that charecter development will be lacking, but that is not the point, the point is these premises that each of these wolds are built on.
