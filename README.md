# The-premise

this is book about travel between worlds.

i put it in this github repository so i can edit it whenever i want across any of my devices.

this is my first novel. to be honest i've always hated creative writing assighnments in school. i started writing it as a way to pass time between (or in) lectures. now that im invested it serves as an outlet for brainchildren of mine that i think of throuought my life. specifically these ideas are for worldbuilding and charecter desighn. going into this i know that charecter development will be lacking, but that is not the point, the point is these premises that each of these wolds are built on.
